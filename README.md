# Visa GroupBuy

Our team was able to integrate the plaid API to determine how much available credit a user has left. We integrated their quickstart guide and wrote code to determine a user's available credit. After entering their bank account details, if the user has a credit card account, their available credit will be printed in the command line. 

An example of the output that's printed in the command line can be found below:

The docs for the plaid API can be found here: https://plaid.com/docs/

Our project would be specifically working with the accounts endpoint: https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/
